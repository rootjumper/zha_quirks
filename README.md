# zha_quirks
custom quirks for zha used in homeassistent (zigbee).

These custom quirks are found somewhere on the internet. I did not create them by myself.
I may have changed something to make it work properly with my zigbee hardware (see comment if present)

see https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-setup-local-zha-quirks/341226/6 for further installation/usage
